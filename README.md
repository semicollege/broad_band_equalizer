# broad_band_equalizer
a broad band equalizer implementing GAL-NLMS algorithm and running on Zynq-7020 FPGA
This is the competition work I have done with my friend.   

Here is the code of GAL algorithm part, which is running on FPGA.    
NLMS is not provided, it is running on ARM dule core.  
You can get a video introduction of this project if you understand Chinese:

The full report is uploaded, if you can read Chinese.    


Here is the GAL-NLMS algorithm:
