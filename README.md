# Broad_band_equalizer on Zynq-7020
A broad band equalizer implementing GAL-NLMS algorithm and running on Zynq-7020 FPGA.    
This is the Xilinx competition project I have done with my friend.       

Here is the code of GAL algorithm part, which is running on FPGA.    
NLMS is not provided, it is running on ARM dule core.       
You can get a video introduction of this project if you understand Chinese:

The full report is also uploaded, if you can read Chinese.         

Here is the GAL-NLMS algorithm:
